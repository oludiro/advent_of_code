# Advent of Code Exercise
#### by Oktavianus Ludiro

## Why


## Dev Dependency
I am using this code puzzle to exercize my ES6 coding knowledge, for that I will
need `babel` to allow me use ES6 and then transpile it and run it in `node`.

```
npm install
```

the `index.js` will import all the answer files and run it in sequence. the `start`
script in `package.json` will allow you to do so.

```
npm start
```
